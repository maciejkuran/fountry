# Find a country with fountry

<p align="center"><img src="/src/img/fountry banner.jpg"></p>

The fountry app is my next project, this time practicing `asynchronous` tasks in JavaScript. I developed fountry in the<b> MVC architecture pattern</b>. I focused on the architecture of the application and a good, logical division of the code.

This project is complex in the context of `fetching data` from various APIs: `Rest Countries API`, `Unsplash.com API`, `Wikipedia API`. I also used the `Leaflet library` (interactive maps) to render `coords` of a country/capital.

I tried to work out every detail, from formatting `user input` to handling and throwing `errors` if something went wrong when `fetching` data.

## What is fountry ?

The fountry app allows you to search for any country in the world, provides basic information, geo location on the world map, amazing photographs and helpful source links to Wikipedia articles.
